# OAC_Planner
 
This project is a **planning algorithm** for **crawler robots** with swing arms to **cross** and **avoid** obstacles in complex unstructured scenes, the full name is obstacle avoidance and obstacle crossing planner(**OAC_Planner**)

 
## Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites

#### 1.1 Ubuntu and ROS
Ubuntu >= 18.04

ROS >= noetic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).

#### 1.2. PCL && Eigen
PCL >= 1.8, Follow [PCL Installation](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html).

Eigen >= 3.3.4, Follow [Eigen Installation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

#### 1.3. livox_ros_driver(optical)
Follow [livox_ros_driver Installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver).

Remarks:

The overall planner is based on the FAST_LIO and LIO_SAM SLAM method to complete the positioning and mapping, and the FAST_LIO is completely based on the Livox series of radars, so if you use the SLAM algorithm in the project or other SLAM algorithms based on Livox radar, you need to install Livox ROS Driver.


#### 1.4 GTSAM

Gtsam >= 4.0.0 Follow [Gtsam Installation](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam).

#### 1.5 Necessary Package

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ompl
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-robot-state-publisher*
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-joint-state-controller*
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-controller*
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-velocity-controllers*
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-eigen*
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-velodyne*
pip install casadi


sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-geographic-*
sudo apt-get install geographiclib-*
sudo apt-get install libgeographic-*

sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rviz-visual-tools

```

### Installing
 
#### Step.1

 Clone the repository and catkin_make.
 
```bash
mkdir -p OAC_Planner/src
cd OAC_Planner/src/
catkin_init_workspace
git clone https://github.com/xxkklose/OAC_Planner.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
 
#### Step.2
 
1. Start with a dataset

```
cd OAC_Planner
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch planner bringup.launch
```

2. Start with a Livox series Lidar(Defult mid360)

```
cd OAC_Planner
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch planner mid360.launch
```
 

 <!-- TODO -->
